# Regenerate the three example data sets shipped with POEMED. Each is produced by
# the package's own simulator under a homogeneous mediation pattern with a few
# confounders, at a fixed seed, so the data are reproducible and the "truth"
# (which mediators are active, the total indirect effect) travels with them.
# Run with: source("data-raw/example_data.R") from the package root, then
# document the objects in R/data_examples.R and rebuild.
#
# The datasets are kept deliberately small (n a few hundred, p = 100) so the
# help-page examples and tests that use them run in a few seconds.
