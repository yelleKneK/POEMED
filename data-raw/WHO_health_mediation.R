# Assemble the WHO / World Bank health-expenditure mediation data shipped with
# POEMED (objects `WHO_health_mediation` and `WHO_indicator_codebook`). The raw
# source files live OUTSIDE the package and are not redistributed; the shipped
# objects (data/WHO_health_mediation.rda) are the reproducible output. This
# script records exactly how they were built. To re-run it, set `src` below to
# the directory holding the raw merged files.
#
# Provenance. The exposure (annual % growth of GDP per capita) and the five
# health outcomes come from World Bank Open Data; the 57 health-expenditure
# indicators (the candidate mediators) and the WHO region / World Bank income
# group labels come from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED). The
# two sources were merged and entities / indicators with excessive missingness
# dropped, leaving a country-by-year panel of 91 WHO members, 2000--2021.
