# Changelog

## POEMED 1.0.0

### Tuning, empty fits, and the Monte Carlo studies

- The default tuning grid for a continuous outcome is now the grid the
  article’s simulations used, rescaled to the `n` and `p` at hand by the
  rate `sqrt(log(p) / n)` the theory requires of the SCAD tuning
  parameter
  ([`pe_lambda_grid()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_lambda_grid.md),
  new). The review-era code searched a fixed grid of 20 values from 0.05
  to 1 for every design; at the article’s linear design that grid lets
  the identified set’s familywise error rate rise from the reported
  0.000 to about 0.17, and the article’s linear tables did not reproduce
  under it. They do now, within Monte Carlo error. The price is
  global-test power at small designs, measured and stated on
  [`?pe_lambda_grid`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_lambda_grid.md);
  pass the review-era grid explicitly to trade the guarantee back.
  Binary and count outcomes keep the review-era grid as their default
  until the article’s per-panel grids for those families are on record.
- Every fit records the grid it searched and the value HBIC chose in a
  `"tuning"` attribute and reports it in the print footer, with a note
  when the choice sat at the grid’s lower end (where the grid’s floor,
  not HBIC, decided the fit).
- A penalized fit that selects no mediator at any grid value now warns
  (condition class `poemed_empty_fit`), sets an `"empty_fit"` attribute,
  says so in the print footer, and keeps the full row schema with `NA`
  confidence limits, instead of silently returning statistics of 0 and
  p-values of 1 with no interval rows. The values follow the article’s
  Monte Carlo convention (an empty selection is a non-rejection).
- [`pe_power_curve()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_power_curve.md),
  [`pe_simulation_study()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_simulation_study.md),
  [`pe_identification_study()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_identification_study.md),
  and
  [`ss_power_pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/ss_power_pe_mediation.md)
  accept `lambda_grid` and `lambda_grid_reduced`, so the article’s
  studies can be run at the grids behind its tables; they report the
  empty fits per grid point in a new `n_empty` column, validate their
  design arguments instead of returning `NaN` rates, warn when
  replications fail (quoting the first error), and refuse an
  `outcome_args` entry (such as `seed`) that would override the design
  or make every replication identical.
- [`pe_identification_study()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_identification_study.md)
  scores the four metrics as the article’s supplement does (a mediator
  with a nonzero outcome coefficient counts as active, and an empty
  selection scores precision 0), with a `truth` argument for the
  both-paths definition. The supplement’s tables now reproduce within
  Monte Carlo error under the default grid.
- The confidence-interval rows `total_indirect_lower` and
  `total_indirect_upper` (a Wald interval) are documented, and the
  interval rows are present on every fit.
- Seeds go through
  [`withr::local_seed()`](https://withr.r-lib.org/reference/with_seed.html):
  a supplied `seed` reproduces a run bit for bit and the caller’s
  generator state and kind are restored on exit, with `cores > 1`
  included; the package never touches `.Random.seed` or the global
  environment itself.
- Input validation names the argument: missing, `NaN`, or infinite
  values in `X`, `Y`, `M`, or `Z`, a constant exposure or confounder
  column, and a single-column `M` stop with a clear message instead of
  surfacing as an error from glmnet or the coordinate descent.
- The broom generics
  [`tidy()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/poemed_broom.md)
  and
  [`glance()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/poemed_broom.md)
  are re-exported, so they work after
  [`library(POEMED)`](https://github.com/yelleKneK/POEMED) alone;
  [`glance()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/poemed_broom.md)
  reports one total-indirect-effect column per exposure.
  [`pe_selection()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_selection.md)
  returns a `poemed_tbl`, and the p-value columns of every wide table
  (`pval_hdmm`, `pval_pe`, the per-method columns, `screen_p`) print to
  four fixed decimals with the `< 0.0001` floor like the p-value rows of
  a fit.
- The test suite pins the three shipped example fits to the values of
  the reference implementation at full precision, pins the article’s
  real-data active sets exactly, and verifies the seed contract of every
  seeded function at runtime.
- Every reference carries its DOI, and the article’s sections are cited
  by the numbering of the accepted article.

### Names, arguments, and vocabulary

- The level at which a replication or a group counts as a rejection is
  `alpha_level` in
  [`pe_power_curve()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_power_curve.md),
  [`pe_simulation_study()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_simulation_study.md),
  [`ss_power_pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/ss_power_pe_mediation.md),
  and
  [`summary.poemed_tbl()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/summary.poemed_tbl.md)
  (it was `alpha`), the portfolio’s name for a significance level;
  `error_level` remains the screening level of the
  mediator-identification step.
- Column names travel to the output. With a named `M` (a named matrix or
  a data.frame) the print footer names the active mediators, the
  mediator table
  ([`pe_mediators()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediators.md),
  [`tidy()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/poemed_broom.md))
  gains a `name` column, and
  [`pe_selection()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_selection.md)
  lists names; the `"mediator_names"` attribute carries them. With
  several named exposures the per-exposure rows are suffixed with the
  exposure’s column name instead of `_1`, `_2`, … . An unnamed analysis
  is unchanged, and no number or position changes.
- [`simulate_mediation_data()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_mediation_data.md)
  validates `n`, `p`, `q`, `d`, `c1`, `c2`, `rho`, and `sigma_y` by
  name;
  [`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
  validates its levels, grids, `cores`, flags, and `data` up front (a
  wrong `data` used to return a table of `NA` rows without a word),
  names the groups it skipped in a message and any failed fit in a
  warning, and records both in a `"notes"` attribute;
  [`summary.poemed_tbl()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/summary.poemed_tbl.md)
  validates `alpha_level`;
  [`print.poemed_tbl()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/poemed_tbl.md)
  and
  [`format.poemed_tbl()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/poemed_tbl.md)
  validate `digits` and `digits_p`.
- The documentation says “the article” and “Yu and Kelley (in press)”
  throughout (the paper is in press, no longer a manuscript), the
  reproduction vignette is `reproducing-the-article`, the name expands
  one way (Power Enhancement for High-Dimensional Mediation Analysis;
  from POwer-Enhanced MEDiation), and the error rate is “familywise”.
- [`?pe_mediation`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md)
  and the guided tour state when POEMED is the right tool and when it is
  not (small `n`, strongly correlated mediators, rare binary outcomes,
  overdispersed counts, missing data), and README points to DMAR for
  low-dimensional mediation models. Every vignette closes with its
  session information.

### New features

- [`simulate_guo_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_guo_mediation.md)
  and the `guo_calibration` data object: the article’s
  real-data-motivated heterogeneous setting, with eleven active
  mediators of mixed sign calibrated to the DNA-methylation case study
  of Guo et al. (2022). The total indirect effect is about `-1.597 * c1`
  (the article’s `-1.5977` is from the full-precision coefficients); the
  calibration constants are shipped and inspectable. This is a genuinely
  heterogeneous data-generating process, distinct from the homogeneous
  and contrasting presets of
  [`simulate_mediation_data()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_mediation_data.md).
- [`pe_identification_study()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_identification_study.md):
  a Monte Carlo study of how well the power-enhanced screen recovers the
  *individual* active mediators, reporting empirical familywise error
  rate, false discovery rate, precision, and recall by signal strength
  and multiplicity method (reproduces the article supplement’s
  identification study).
- [`pe_selection()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_selection.md)
  now reports the power-enhanced statistic, its enhancement component
  `J_m`, and the global p-value under each multiplicity method
  (Bonferroni / BH / BY) side by side, not just the active sets.
- `WHO_mediation_analysis(full_table = TRUE)` returns the article’s
  extended table layout, with the power-enhanced p-value and active
  mediators reported separately under each multiplicity method.
- A [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) method for
  `poemed_tbl` results: for a grouped comparison table such as the
  output of
  [`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md),
  it digests the table across groups and headlines where the
  power-enhanced test detects mediation that the benchmark test misses,
  with the most frequently flagged indicators. Any other `poemed_tbl`
  falls back to the ordinary data-frame summary.
- A `drop_constant` argument to
  [`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md)
  and the outcome-specific workers: zero-variance mediator columns are
  dropped with a warning instead of raising an error, and the reported
  active set is renumbered back to the original mediator columns.
  [`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
  applies this per subgroup, so small region-by-income cells now fit
  instead of being skipped.

### Performance

- The penalized linear fit builds its `[M, X, S]` design matrix once per
  model rather than
  re-[`cbind()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cbind.html)-ing it on each of
  the roughly eighty glmnet calls across the lambda grid. The result is
  numerically identical (the published benchmark values are unchanged)
  and about 8% faster per fit.
- The Monte Carlo and empirical functions
  ([`pe_power_curve()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_power_curve.md),
  [`pe_identification_study()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_identification_study.md),
  [`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md))
  parallelize across replications or subgroups via `cores`, scaling
  near-linearly (about 3.3x on 4 cores). This is the practical lever for
  article-scale studies; the per-fit penalized solver is glmnet-bound.
