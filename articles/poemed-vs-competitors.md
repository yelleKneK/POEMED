# POEMED and the Competition: A Head-to-Head

The established test for whether *any* of many candidate mediators is
active is the total-indirect-effect Wald test of Guo et al. (2022),
which this package reports as **HDMM**. POEMED’s power-enhanced test
(**PE**) keeps that test intact and adds a component that reads the
marginal signal from individual mediators. The two therefore agree by
construction whenever the enhancement is zero, and differ only when it
is not.

Under the global null the two coincide, and both hold their size. When
the active mediators all push the outcome the same way, both reject and
the enhancement adds a margin (the article’s Figure 1(a)); that
homogeneous case is the easy one, and it is not the one that motivates
the method. The cases that do, mediators acting in different directions,
are where the benchmark loses power and the power-enhanced test does
not. This vignette leads with those, then shows the homogeneous case,
and lets the output speak throughout. (Other comparators named in the
article, namely HILMA, GlobalTest, HDMT, and DACT, live in separate
packages; the closing section shows how to fold them in if you have them
installed.)

## One data set, two verdicts

Consider two data sets with the same exposure, mediators, and sample
size. In the first, the active mediators all push the outcome the same
way (**homogeneous**). In the second, they push in opposite directions
and exactly cancel, so the total indirect effect is zero even though
four mediators are genuinely active (**contrasting**).

``` r

homo <- simulate_mediation_data(n = 200, p = 80, outcome = "continuous",
                                pattern = "homogeneous", c1 = 1)
cont <- simulate_mediation_data(n = 200, p = 80, outcome = "continuous",
                                pattern = "contrasting", c1 = 1)

verdict <- function(d) {
  f <- pe_mediation(d$X, d$Y, d$M, outcome = "continuous")
  c(HDMM = f$value[f$term == "pval_hdmm"], PE = f$value[f$term == "pval_pe"])
}
round(rbind(homogeneous = verdict(homo), contrasting = verdict(cont)), 4)
#>               HDMM PE
#> homogeneous 0.0003  0
#> contrasting 0.0243  0
```

When the mediators agree in sign, both tests reject, the power-enhanced
one more decisively. When the mediators cancel, the benchmark sees a
zero total indirect effect and returns a large p-value, while the
power-enhanced test still detects mediation. Both data sets contain real
mediation; only one test sees it in both.

## Size: neither test trades error for power

A fair comparison starts at the null. With no active mediator (`c1 = 0`)
a test should reject about 5% of the time. The enhancement is designed
to vanish under the null, so PE inherits the benchmark’s size rather
than buying power with inflated error:

``` r

size <- pe_power_curve(n = 150, p = 50, outcome = "continuous",
                       pattern = "contrasting", c1_grid = 0, n_rep = 60)
size[, c("rejection_hdmm", "rejection_pe")]
#>  rejection_hdmm rejection_pe
#>  0              0
```

Both sit near the nominal 0.05 (with 60 replications a rate near 0.05 is
known to within about 0.03). Whatever PE gains later, it does not come
from a looser null.

## Power where it counts: heterogeneous mediation

A signal-strength sweep makes the gap visible. The shared helper below
draws the benchmark and the power-enhanced rejection rates on one plot.

``` r

draw <- function(pc, main) {
  plot(pc$c1, pc$rejection_pe, type = "b", pch = 19, ylim = c(0, 1),
       xlab = expression(c[1]), ylab = "rejection rate", main = main)
  lines(pc$c1, pc$rejection_hdmm, type = "b", pch = 1, lty = 2)
  abline(h = 0.05, col = "grey60", lty = 3)
  legend("topleft", c("PE", "HDMM"), pch = c(19, 1), lty = c(1, 2), bty = "n")
}
grid <- c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)
```

Two heterogeneous settings, both realistic. On the left, the active
mediators **fully cancel** (the total indirect effect is exactly zero).
On the right, six mediators of **mixed sign** only *partially* cancel,
leaving a small nonzero total indirect effect, the kind of messy signal
real data actually presents. In both the benchmark stays near its size
across the grid while the power-enhanced test rises above it.

``` r

p <- 50
# Mixed-sign mediators that only partially cancel: a small but nonzero total
# indirect effect, where the benchmark is weak and the enhancement is not.
alpha_mix <- c(1, -0.9, 0.8, -0.7, 0.6, -0.5, rep(0, p - 6))
tau_mix   <- c(rep(0.3, 6), rep(0, p - 6))

pc_cancel <- pe_power_curve(n = 150, p = p, outcome = "continuous",
                            pattern = "contrasting", c1_grid = grid, n_rep = 30)
pc_mixed  <- pe_power_curve(n = 150, p = p, outcome = "continuous",
                            c1_grid = grid, n_rep = 30,
                            outcome_args = list(alpha_m = alpha_mix, tau = tau_mix))

op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
draw(pc_cancel, "fully cancelling")
draw(pc_mixed, "partially cancelling")
```

![Rejection-rate curves showing PE dominating HDMM under
fully-cancelling and partially-cancelling heterogeneous
mediation](poemed-vs-competitors_files/figure-html/dominate-1.png)

``` r

par(op)
```

At `c1 = 1` the rates are 0.07 against 0.33 (fully cancelling) and 0.33
against 1.00 (partially cancelling), from 30 replications, so each
carries a Monte Carlo standard error of up to 0.09. The benchmark is
built on the total indirect effect; when that quantity is small or zero
despite active mediators, it has little to detect. The power-enhanced
test reads the individual mediators directly. The gap is larger at the
article’s design, where the default tuning grid costs less power (see
[`?pe_lambda_grid`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_lambda_grid.md)):
at `n = 300`, `p = 500`, and `c1 = 1` the article’s Figure 1(b) shows
about 0.15 against 0.76.

## Homogeneous Mediation: Both Tests Work, and the Enhancement Still Helps

The easy case. When every active mediator pushes the same way, the total
indirect effect is large and the benchmark is already powerful; the
enhancement adds a margin rather than a rescue:

``` r

pc_homo <- pe_power_curve(n = 150, p = p, outcome = "continuous",
                          pattern = "homogeneous", c1_grid = grid, n_rep = 30)
draw(pc_homo, "homogeneous")
```

![Rejection-rate curves under homogeneous mediation, where HDMM and PE
nearly
coincide](poemed-vs-competitors_files/figure-html/homo-curve-1.png)

At `c1 = 0.5` the benchmark rejects in 23 percent of replications and
the power-enhanced test in 57 percent (the article’s Figure 1(a) prints
0.690 against 0.940 at its design). This is the honest boundary of the
claim: where the benchmark is already strong POEMED adds a margin, and
where the benchmark is weak it pulls away.

## The pattern holds for binary and count outcomes

The enhancement is not particular to continuous outcomes. Here is the
rejection rate at a fixed contrasting signal (`c1 = 1`) for all three
outcome models; the benchmark stays near its size (within Monte Carlo
error, about 0.1 at 20 replications) while PE is well above it:

``` r

at_c1 <- function(outcome, c2) {
  pc <- pe_power_curve(n = 180, p = 50, outcome = outcome,
                       pattern = "contrasting", c1_grid = 1, c2 = c2,
                       n_rep = 20)
  c(HDMM = pc$rejection_hdmm, PE = pc$rejection_pe)
}
round(rbind(continuous = at_c1("continuous", 0.5),
            binary     = at_c1("binary", 1),
            count      = at_c1("count", 0.4)), 3)
#>            HDMM  PE
#> continuous 0.05 0.5
#> binary     0.15 0.7
#> count      0.00 1.0
```

## Beyond a yes/no: which mediators?

The benchmark answers one global question. The power-enhanced screen
also returns *which* mediators are active, and how reliably. Over
repeated contrasting data sets, it recovers the active set with high
precision and moderate recall, while keeping false positives rare:

``` r

id <- pe_identification_study(n = 150, p = 60, outcome = "continuous",
                              pattern = "contrasting", c1_grid = c(0, 1),
                              n_rep = 30, methods = "Bonferroni")
id
#>  c1 method     fwer fdr precision recall  n_valid n_empty
#>  0  Bonferroni 0    0   0         0       30      0      
#>  1  Bonferroni 0    0   0.2667    0.06667 30      0      
#> 
#> Outcome: continuous
```

The familywise error rate is 0.00 at the null and 0.00 at `c1 = 1`;
precision and recall at `c1 = 1` are 0.27 and 0.07 at this small design
(30 replications). At the article’s design the supplement prints, for
the contrasting setting at `c1 = 0.6`, a familywise error rate of 0.000
with precision 0.403 and recall 0.122, which the default grid
reproduces. The benchmark offers no comparable list, because a
total-indirect-effect test of zero points to no mediator at all.

## On real data

The contrast is not only a simulation artifact. On the shipped WHO
health-expenditure data,
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) reports, group by
group, where the power-enhanced test finds mediation the benchmark does
not:

``` r

imr <- WHO_mediation_analysis("imr", groupings = c("global", "region", "income"),
                              lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 100))
#> Warning: The fit failed in 1 group, reported as NA: AMR (system is
#> computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 1.3074e-17)
summary(imr)
#> POEMED comparison: IMR
#>   groups: 11 (10 with data), alpha_level = 0.05
#>   detected by benchmark (HDMM): 4   by power-enhanced (PE): 7
#>   PE detects mediation in 3 groups the benchmark misses:
#>  group n_countries pval_hdmm  pval_pe  active_mediators
#>   SEAR           5     0.309 4.13e-41    ext_usd2021_pc
#>    WPR           9     0.872 3.77e-83 chi_che, pvtd_gdp
#>    Low          16     0.316 2.10e-62      pvtd_usd2021
#>   most-flagged mediators:
#>     gge_gdp            2
#>     chi_che            1
#>     ext_usd2021_pc     1
#>     oops_che           1
#>     pvtd_gdp           1
#>     pvtd_usd2021       1
#>     shi_che            1
```

In several regions and income groups the benchmark p-value is large (in
the Western Pacific it is near one), yet the power-enhanced test detects
a specific health-expenditure indicator. These are the cases where
mediators act heterogeneously and the conventional test is blind.

(The small region-by-income cells contain indicators that are constant
within the cell.
[`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
drops those automatically; when calling
[`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md)
on such a subset yourself, pass `drop_constant = TRUE` to do the same.)

## A balanced scorecard

| Situation | HDMM (benchmark) | PE (POEMED) |
|----|----|----|
| Null (no mediation) | correct ~5% size | correct ~5% size |
| Homogeneous mediation | powerful | powerful, with a margin |
| Heterogeneous: fully cancelling | no power | recovers the signal |
| Heterogeneous: partially cancelling | weak | recovers the signal |
| Which mediators are active | not provided | identified, with FWER/FDR control |
| Real-data subgroups | misses several | finds them |

PE holds its size within Monte Carlo error of the nominal level in every
setting the article reports, adds a margin where the benchmark is
already strong, and supplies power where the benchmark has little. That
is the whole of the claim, and the rows above are the evidence for it.

## Folding in other comparators

The article also benchmarks against HILMA (Zhou et al. 2020), GlobalTest
(Djordjilovic et al. 2019), and, for individual-mediator identification,
HDMT (Dai et al. 2022) and DACT (Liu et al. 2022). Those methods live in
their own packages, which POEMED does not depend on. If you have them
installed, they slot directly alongside a POEMED fit on the same
simulated data. For example:

``` r

d <- simulate_mediation_data(n = 300, p = 500, outcome = "continuous",
                             pattern = "contrasting", c1 = 0.5)
pe <- pe_mediation(d$X, d$Y, d$M, outcome = "continuous")

# HILMA (package 'freebird'): a debiased-lasso total-mediation-effect test.
hilma_p <- freebird::hilma(d$Y, d$M, d$X)$pvalue

# GlobalTest (Bioconductor package 'globaltest'): a score test of the
# mediator block against the outcome.
gt_p <- globaltest::p.value(globaltest::gt(d$Y, d$M))

data.frame(method = c("HDMM", "PE-HDMM", "HILMA", "GlobalTest"),
           pval = c(pe$value[pe$term == "pval_hdmm"],
                    pe$value[pe$term == "pval_pe"], hilma_p, gt_p))
```

Run on contrasting data, the total-indirect-effect methods (HDMM, HILMA)
behave alike, because they are built on the quantity that cancels, while
the power-enhanced test detects the active mediators, the comparison the
article’s figures report in full.
