# Reproducing the Article's Analyses With POEMED

This vignette walks through **each analysis in the article** “Power
Enhancement in High-Dimensional Heterogeneous Mediation Analysis” (in
press at the *Journal of the American Statistical Association*) and
reproduces it with POEMED. It follows the article’s own structure: the
Monte Carlo simulation study (its Section 4, with the identification
study in Section S.4.1 of its supplement) and the empirical data
analysis (its Section 5). The companion vignette *Power Enhancement for
High-Dimensional Mediation: A Guided Tour* introduces the method itself;
here the focus is faithful replication.

**Two things to keep in mind while reading.**

1.  *Scope of the comparison.* The article benchmarks the power-enhanced
    tests (PE-HDMM for linear outcomes, PE-HDGMM for generalized
    outcomes) against several competitors: HDMM, HILMA, and GlobalTest.
    POEMED implements the proposed PE tests and the **HDMM** benchmark
    (the total-indirect-effect Wald test that the PE component
    augments). Every POEMED result therefore reports the central
    contrast of the article’s figures and tables, **PE versus HDMM**;
    HILMA and GlobalTest are separate methods outside this package.

2.  *Run size.* The article’s simulations use `n = 300`, `p = 500`, and
    **1,000 replications** per design point. Reproducing that here would
    take far too long for a vignette, so the live code uses small `n`,
    `p`, and `n_rep`; the curves have the right *shape* but are noisier.
    Each simulation section also shows the exact article settings in an
    `eval = FALSE` block you can run yourself.

``` r

set.seed(113)
```

## Part I. Monte Carlo Simulation (Article Section 4)

The simulation study asks two questions of every test. Under the global
null of no active mediator (`c1 = 0`) the rejection rate estimates the
**Type I error rate**, which should sit near the nominal level,
`alpha_level = 0.05`. Away from the null (`c1 != 0`) the rejection rate
estimates **power**.
[`pe_power_curve()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_power_curve.md)
sweeps `c1` and returns both the benchmark (`rejection_hdmm`) and
power-enhanced (`rejection_pe`) rejection rates at each grid point.

A small helper draws an article-style rejection-rate figure for one
design:

``` r

plot_rejection <- function(pc, main) {
  plot(pc$c1, pc$rejection_pe, type = "b", pch = 19, ylim = c(0, 1),
       xlab = expression(c[1] * "  (signal strength)"),
       ylab = "empirical rejection rate", main = main)
  lines(pc$c1, pc$rejection_hdmm, type = "b", pch = 1, lty = 2)
  abline(h = 0.05, col = "grey60", lty = 3)
  legend("right", c("PE (proposed)", "HDMM (benchmark)"),
         pch = c(19, 1), lty = c(1, 2), bty = "n")
}
```

### Section 4.1: Linear Mediation Models

The article studies a univariate exposure with `n = 300` continuous
outcomes and `p = 500` candidate mediators whose noise has an
autoregressive `0.5^|i-j|` covariance. The mediator-exposure coefficient
is `Gamma_x = c1 * tau`, where `tau` is 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 for the
five mediators with a nonzero outcome coefficient and an independent
N(0, 0.5^2) draw for each of the others, the direct effect is
`c2 = 0.5`, and two outcome-mediator patterns are contrasted:

- **Setting (i), homogeneous:**
  `alpha_m = (1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0, ...)`, so all active mediators
  push the same way and the total indirect effect is `beta = 0.7 * c1`
  (nonzero). This is the regime where ordinary tests already work; the
  question is whether PE *adds* power.
- **Setting (ii), contrasting:**
  `alpha_m = (1, -0.5, 0.4, -0.3, 0, ...)`, four active mediators whose
  effects cancel so the total indirect effect is `beta = 0` for every
  `c1`. This is the regime that defeats a total-indirect-effect test,
  and where PE is designed to rescue power.

POEMED maps these to `pattern = "homogeneous"` and
`pattern = "contrasting"` in
[`simulate_mediation_data()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_mediation_data.md)
and
[`pe_power_curve()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_power_curve.md).
The reduced live run (the article’s Figure for linear models):

``` r

set.seed(113)
lm_homo <- pe_power_curve(n = 150, p = 50, outcome = "continuous",
                          pattern = "homogeneous",
                          c1_grid = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
                          c2 = 0.5, n_rep = 25)
lm_cont <- pe_power_curve(n = 150, p = 50, outcome = "continuous",
                          pattern = "contrasting",
                          c1_grid = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
                          c2 = 0.5, n_rep = 25)

op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot_rejection(lm_homo, "(i) homogeneous")
plot_rejection(lm_cont, "(ii) contrasting")
```

![Reduced reproduction of the article's linear-model rejection-rate
figure for the homogeneous and contrasting
settings](reproducing-the-article_files/figure-html/lm-curves-1.png)

``` r

par(op)
```

At this reduced design (`n = 150`, `p = 50`, 25 replications, so a Monte
Carlo standard error of up to 0.10 per rate) the curves have the
article’s shape, not its values. Under the **homogeneous** setting both
tests gain power as the signal grows (at `c1 = 1`, benchmark 0.84, PE
0.96). Under the **contrasting** setting the benchmark rejects in 8
percent of replications at `c1 = 1` and the power-enhanced test in 16
percent. The article’s values at its design (`n = 300`, `p = 500`, 1000
replications; its Figure 1 and the supplement’s table of designs) are
the converged numbers a reported analysis deserves:

| Setting | `c1` | HDMM | PE-HDMM |
|----|----|----|----|
| homogeneous | 0 | 0.037 | 0.051 |
| homogeneous | 0.5 | 0.690 | 0.940 |
| contrasting | 0 | 0.036 | 0.044 |
| contrasting | 0.5 | 0.087 | 0.331 |
| contrasting | 1 | about 0.15 (read from Figure 1) | about 0.76 (read from Figure 1) |

The default tuning grid, the article’s grid rescaled to the design (see
[`?pe_lambda_grid`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_lambda_grid.md)),
reproduces these within Monte Carlo error: 500 replications during the
package’s release audit gave 0.048 and 0.062, 0.666 and 0.940, 0.036 and
0.048, and 0.096 and 0.326 for the first four rows. One feature of the
article’s figure is worth noticing: under the contrasting setting the
benchmark’s rate rises above its size at `c1 = 1`. The penalized fit
sometimes keeps only one member of a cancelling pair, and the total
indirect effect through the selected mediators is then not zero. That is
a property of the grid as much as of the test.

To reproduce the article’s figure at its actual resolution (including
the negative half of the `c1` grid, which the symmetric design fills
in), run:

``` r

c1_grid <- seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1)
lm_homo_full <- pe_power_curve(n = 300, p = 500, outcome = "continuous",
                               pattern = "homogeneous", c1_grid = c1_grid,
                               c2 = 0.5, n_rep = 1000, cores = 4)
lm_cont_full <- pe_power_curve(n = 300, p = 500, outcome = "continuous",
                               pattern = "contrasting", c1_grid = c1_grid,
                               c2 = 0.5, n_rep = 1000, cores = 4)
```

[`pe_simulation_study()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_simulation_study.md)
is a convenience wrapper that runs several patterns at once and stacks
the results, which is how the article’s figure panels are produced:

``` r

study <- pe_simulation_study(n = 300, p = 500, outcome = "continuous",
                             patterns = c("homogeneous", "contrasting"),
                             c1_grid = seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1), n_rep = 1000)
```

#### The Real-Data-Motivated Heterogeneous Setting (Supplement)

The supplement adds a third, harder pattern: a setting calibrated to the
DNA-methylation case study of Guo et al. (2022), with **eleven active
mediators of mixed sign** that neither all agree (homogeneous) nor
exactly cancel (contrasting).
[`simulate_guo_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_guo_mediation.md)
generates it from the calibration constants shipped as
\[`guo_calibration`\]; the total indirect effect is
`guo_calibration$beta_per_c1 * c1`, about `-1.597 * c1`. (The article
reports `-1.5977`, computed from the full-precision Guo coefficients;
the package ships those coefficients rounded to the three decimals
printed in the supplement, which give `-1.597`.)

``` r

d <- simulate_guo_mediation(c1 = 1, seed = 113)
dim(d$M)                              # 85 x 1008, the case-study dimensions
#> [1]   85 1008
d$active_mediators                    # the 11 active loci
#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
round(d$beta, 4)                      # beta_per_c1 * c1, i.e. about -1.597
#> [1] -1.597
```

The fit below uses a wide grid, 50 values from 0.1 to 10, as the guided
tour does for this setting. With it both tests reject at `n = 150`, and
the power-enhanced screen recovers several of the mixed-sign loci:

``` r

dn <- simulate_guo_mediation(c1 = 1, n = 150, seed = 113)
fit <- pe_mediation(dn$X, dn$Y, dn$M, outcome = "continuous",
                    lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 10, length.out = 50))
fit[fit$term %in% c("pval_hdmm", "pval_pe", "n_active_mediators"), ]
#>  term               value   
#>  pval_hdmm          < 0.0001
#>  pval_pe            < 0.0001
#>  n_active_mediators 6       
#> 
#> Outcome model: continuous (linear)
#> Active mediators identified (6): 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10
#> Tuning parameter (HBIC): lambda = 0.1 from 50 values in [0.1, 10] (the grid's lower end)
```

The article’s figure sweeps `c1` over `c(0, +/- 0.1, ..., +/- 1)` at the
case-study size `n = 85`, with and without the calibrated confounders,
averaged over 1,000 replications:

``` r

rej <- function(c1, confounders) {
  ps <- replicate(1000, {
    d <- simulate_guo_mediation(c1 = c1, confounders = confounders)
    f <- pe_mediation(d$X, d$Y, d$M, Z = d$Z, outcome = "continuous",
                      lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 10, length.out = 50))
    c(f$value[f$term == "pval_hdmm"], f$value[f$term == "pval_pe"])
  })
  rowMeans(ps <= 0.05)
}
sapply(seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1), rej, confounders = FALSE)
```

### Section 4.2: Mediation Models With Generalized Linear Outcomes

The same construction is repeated for non-continuous outcomes through a
link function: a **logistic** model for binary outcomes (PE-HDGMM versus
HDGMM) and a **Poisson** model for counts. Again `n = 300`, `p = 500`,
with a homogeneous and a contrasting pattern apiece; the article fixes
the direct effect at `c2 = 1` for the logistic models and `c2 = 0.4` for
the Poisson models.

Here is the dramatic **contrasting** case for each outcome type (the
panel where PE most clearly rescues power), at reduced size:

``` r

set.seed(113)
logit_cont <- pe_power_curve(n = 180, p = 50, outcome = "binary",
                             pattern = "contrasting",
                             c1_grid = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
                             c2 = 1, n_rep = 20)
pois_cont <- pe_power_curve(n = 180, p = 50, outcome = "count",
                            pattern = "contrasting",
                            c1_grid = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
                            c2 = 0.4, n_rep = 20)

op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot_rejection(logit_cont, "Logistic, contrasting")
plot_rejection(pois_cont, "Poisson, contrasting")
```

![Reduced reproduction of the article's logistic and Poisson
rejection-rate figures under the contrasting
setting](reproducing-the-article_files/figure-html/glm-curves-1.png)

``` r

par(op)
```

As in the article, the benchmark HDGMM has little power against
contrasting effects while PE-HDGMM gains substantial power, all while
holding the size at `c1 = 0` (20 replications here, so each rate carries
a Monte Carlo standard error of up to 0.11). The article’s contrasting
rows at `n = 300`, `p = 500`, and `c1 = 0.5` (logistic) or `0.4`
(Poisson) are: logistic, size 0.035 and 0.044, power 0.065 and 0.243;
Poisson, size 0.028 and 0.046, power 0.082 and 0.915 (HDGMM then
PE-HDGMM). For binary and count outcomes the default grid is the
review-era grid, under which the release audit reproduced the Poisson
row (0.060 and 0.905) and the logistic row within Monte Carlo error. The
full article designs, including the homogeneous panels:

``` r

c1_grid <- seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1)
# Logistic: c2 = 1
for (pat in c("homogeneous", "contrasting"))
  pe_power_curve(n = 300, p = 500, outcome = "binary", pattern = pat,
                 c1_grid = c1_grid, c2 = 1, n_rep = 1000, cores = 4)
# Poisson: c2 = 0.4
for (pat in c("homogeneous", "contrasting"))
  pe_power_curve(n = 300, p = 500, outcome = "count", pattern = pat,
                 c1_grid = c1_grid, c2 = 0.4, n_rep = 1000, cores = 4)
```

### Supplement Section S.4.1: Identifying Individual Mediators (FWER and FDR)

Beyond the global test, the article’s supplement studies how well the PE
machinery **identifies which** individual mediators are active, and
whether it controls the familywise error rate (FWER) or false discovery
rate (FDR). POEMED exposes this through the `method` argument
(`"Bonferroni"` for FWER, `"BH"` or `"BY"` for FDR) and the
`report_all_methods` switch, which reports all three side by side as the
supplement does.

For a *single* fit,
[`pe_selection()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_selection.md)
reports the active set under each method side by side, together with the
power-enhanced statistic and p-value each one produces (the screened set
feeds `J_m`, so the methods can give different global p-values, exactly
the PE / PE_BH / PE_BY columns of the article’s extended tables):

``` r

set.seed(113)
d <- simulate_mediation_data(n = 200, p = 60, outcome = "continuous",
                             pattern = "contrasting", c1 = 1)
d$active_mediators                                  # ground truth
#> [1] 1 2 3 4

fit_all <- pe_mediation(d$X, d$Y, d$M, outcome = "continuous",
                        report_all_methods = TRUE)
pe_selection(fit_all)                               # per-method sets + p-values
#>  method     n_active j_pe  stat_pe pval_pe  active_mediators
#>  Bonferroni 1        174.1 174.2   < 0.0001 2               
#>  BH         1        174.1 174.2   < 0.0001 2               
#>  BY         1        174.1 174.2   < 0.0001 2
```

To reproduce the supplement’s identification *study* (its empirical
FWER, FDR, precision, and recall over many replications),
[`pe_identification_study()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_identification_study.md)
scores each method’s selections against the truth set across a grid of
`c1`, with the supplement’s definitions: a mediator counts as truly
active when its outcome coefficient is nonzero, so at `c1 = 0` the five
such mediators are the truth set, `fwer` is the probability of selecting
a mediator outside it, and `recall` is the share of the five that were
selected (pass `truth = "mediation"` for the both-paths definition,
under which nothing is active at `c1 = 0` and `recall` is `NA` there):

``` r

set.seed(113)
id <- pe_identification_study(n = 150, p = 60, outcome = "continuous",
                              pattern = "contrasting", c1_grid = c(0, 0.5, 1),
                              n_rep = 30)
id
#>  c1  method     fwer fdr precision recall  n_valid n_empty

#>  0.5 BH         0    0   0.2       0.05    30      0      
#>  0.5 BY         0    0   0.1667    0.04167 30      0      
#>  1   Bonferroni 0    0   0.3333    0.09167 30      0      
#>  1   BH         0    0   0.3333    0.1083  30      0

#> 
#> Outcome: continuous
```

At this small design the Bonferroni screen names no false mediator in
any of the 30 replications at any `c1`, and at `c1 = 1` its precision is
0.33 with recall 0.09 (30 replications; standard error up to 0.09). The
article’s summary, “close-to-zero empirical FWER and FDR, high
precision, but medium-to-low recall,” describes its own design: at
`n = 300`, `p = 500`, and `c1 = 0.6` the supplement’s table prints, for
the contrasting setting, FWER 0.000, FDR 0.000, precision 0.403, and
recall 0.122, and for the homogeneous setting 0.000, 0.000, 0.984, and
0.497. The default grid reproduces those within Monte Carlo error (500
replications during the release audit: 0.000, 0.000, 0.406, 0.124 and
0.000, 0.000, 0.972, 0.482). The article-scale study raises `n`, `p`,
and `n_rep` to 300 / 500 / 1000:

``` r

pe_identification_study(n = 300, p = 500, outcome = "continuous",
                        pattern = "contrasting", c1_grid = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1),
                        n_rep = 1000, cores = 4)
```

## Part II. Empirical Data Analysis (Article Section 5)

The article asks whether health-care expenditure mediates the
relationship between economic growth and population health across the
world’s countries. POEMED ships that exact data set,
`WHO_health_mediation`: a country-by-year panel (2000–2021) with

- **Exposure** `X`: annual growth in GDP per capita (World Bank),
- **Mediators** `M`: 57 health-expenditure indicators (WHO Global Health
  Expenditure Database),
- **Outcomes** `Y`: five health outcomes, infant mortality (`imr`),
  under-five mortality (`u5mr`), life expectancy (`leb`), low
  birthweight (`lbw`), and undernourishment (`pou`),

with WHO region and World Bank income group available as the grouping
and confounding variables.

``` r

data(WHO_health_mediation)
dim(WHO_health_mediation)
#> [1] 2002   68
table(WHO_health_mediation$region)
#> 
#>  AFR  AMR  EMR  EUR SEAR  WPR 
#>  704  616  176  198  110  198
```

### Section 5, Table 1: Infant Mortality (IMR)

[`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
reproduces the article’s per-outcome table: it fits the global model
(region, income, and year as confounders), then a separate model within
each WHO region (income and year as confounders) and each income group
(region and year as confounders), and reports the HDMM and PE p-values
for the total indirect effect together with the active mediators the PE
component identifies.

The function uses the two tuning grids of Yu and Kelley (in press): a
narrower `lambda_grid_global = seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 100)` for the
global all-country model and a wider
`lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 10, length.out = 100)` for every subgroup model.
Both grids are the defaults, so no explicit arguments are needed to
reproduce the article exactly.

``` r

imr <- WHO_mediation_analysis("imr", groupings = c("global", "region", "income"))
imr[, c("group", "n_countries", "pval_hdmm", "pval_pe", "active_mediators")]

Read this against the article’s IMR table. The headline reproductions:

- **Global (ALL):** general government expenditure as a share of GDP
  (`gge_gdp`) is the active mediator; HDMM is borderline (`pval_hdmm` =
  0.041) while PE is essentially zero.
- **SEAR (South-East Asia):** HDMM sees nothing (`pval_hdmm` = 0.31) yet
  PE rejects decisively, naming external health expenditure per capita
  (`ext_usd2021_pc`). This is a textbook heterogeneous-mediation rescue.
- **WPR (Western Pacific):** HDMM is near 1 (`pval_hdmm` = 0.87) while
  PE detects compulsory health insurance and private expenditure
  (`chi_che`, `pvtd_gdp`).
- **EUR (Europe):** both tests reject; PE identifies general government
  expenditure as a share of GDP (`gge_gdp`).
- **AFR, AMR:** no active mediation, by either test.

These are precisely the cases the article highlights, where contrasting
or heterogeneous mediation hides the signal from the conventional test
and the PE component recovers it.

The income-group rows are returned in the same call; the strongest
signals appear in the low- and high-income groups, matching the article.

[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) digests the whole
table, highlighting the groups where the power-enhanced test detects
mediation the benchmark misses (the rows the article prints in bold):

``` r

summary(imr)
#> POEMED comparison: IMR
#>   groups: 11 (11 with data), alpha_level = 0.05
#>   detected by benchmark (HDMM): 4   by power-enhanced (PE): 7
#>   PE detects mediation in 3 groups the benchmark misses:
#>  group n_countries pval_hdmm  pval_pe  active_mediators
#>   SEAR           5     0.309 4.13e-41    ext_usd2021_pc
#>    WPR           9     0.872 3.77e-83 chi_che, pvtd_gdp
#>    Low          16     0.316 2.10e-62      pvtd_usd2021
#>   most-flagged mediators:
#>     gge_gdp            2
#>     chi_che            1
#>     ext_usd2021_pc     1
#>     oops_che           1
#>     pvtd_gdp           1
#>     pvtd_usd2021       1
#>     shi_che            1
```

The supplement also gives an **extended** version of each table that
breaks the power-enhanced result out by multiplicity method. Pass
`full_table = TRUE` to get that layout, with the PE p-value and active
mediators reported separately under Bonferroni (FWER), BH, and BY (FDR):

``` r

WHO_mediation_analysis("imr", groupings = "global", full_table = TRUE)
#>  grouping group n_countries pval_hdmm pval_pe_bonferroni active_bonferroni
#>  global   ALL   91          0.0409    < 0.0001           gge_gdp          
#>  pval_pe_bh active_bh        pval_pe_by active_by
#>  < 0.0001   chi_che, gge_gdp < 0.0001   gge_gdp  
#> 
#> Outcome: imr
```

### The Other Outcomes, and the Region-by-Income Cells

The remaining article outcomes (under-five mortality, life expectancy,
low birthweight, and undernourishment) run identically; only the outcome
code changes:

``` r

for (y in c("u5mr", "leb", "lbw", "pou"))
  print(WHO_mediation_analysis(y, groupings = c("global", "region", "income")))
```

The article also drills into the **region-by-income** cells (for
example, AFR-Low or WPR-High). Build any one cell with
[`WHO_mediation_design()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_design.md),
which assembles the exposure, outcome, mediator, and confounder blocks
for a chosen subset, then call
[`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md).
A small cell can contain indicators that never vary inside it; passing
`drop_constant = TRUE` drops those zero-variance columns with a warning
and keeps the reported active set numbered against the original
mediators
([`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
does the same internally):

``` r

cell <- WHO_mediation_design("imr", region = "AFR", income = "Upper-middle")
c(n_countries= cell$n_countries, mediators = ncol(cell$M))
#> n_countries   mediators 
#>           4          57

keep <- apply(cell$M, 2L, sd) > 0
fit <- tryCatch(
  pe_mediation(scale(cell$X), cell$Y - mean(cell$Y),
               scale(cell$M[, keep, drop = FALSE]),
               Z = cell$Z, outcome = "continuous", scale = FALSE,
               lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 100)),
  error = function(e) NULL)
if (is.null(fit)) "singular covariance (cell too small)" else
  cell$indicators[keep][attr(fit, "active_mediators")]
#> [1] "pvtd_ncu2021_pc"
```

### Why a Mediator? Opening Up the Screening Step

For any fit,
[`pe_mediators()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediators.md)
shows the evidence the PE component acted on, the two path statistics,
their p-values, the combined screening p-value, and the active flag for
every candidate the penalized fit selected. This is the per-mediator
detail behind the last column of the article’s tables.

``` r

des <- WHO_mediation_design("imr")                  # global IMR design
gfit <- pe_mediation(scale(des$X), des$Y - mean(des$Y), scale(des$M),
                     Z = des$Z, outcome = "continuous", scale = FALSE,
                     lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 100))
pe_mediators(gfit)

## Reproducibility Notes

- The global, regional, and income analyses above are deterministic.
  [`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
  uses a tuning grid whose defaults are set to be
  `lambda_grid_global = seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 100)` for the
  all-country model. Calling the function with no explicit grid
  arguments reproduces the active mediators and p-values shown here,
  which the package’s test suite checks as a fixed benchmark.
- The Monte Carlo sections are stochastic. The reduced runs reproduce
  the *shape* of the article’s curves; the `eval = FALSE` blocks give
  the exact `n = 300`, `p = 500`, 1,000-replication settings. Set
  `cores` above 1 to parallelize and `seed` for exact reproducibility.
- Exact real-data p-values depend on the preprocessing the article fixes
  (standardizing the exposure and mediators, centering the outcome,
  leaving the confounder indicators unscaled, and using treatment
  contrasts with alphabetical reference levels for the region and income
  factors);
  [`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
  applies all of this for you. See the guided-tour vignette for doing it
  by hand.
