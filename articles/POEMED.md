# Power Enhancement for High-Dimensional Mediation: A Guided Tour

This vignette is written for a reader who is comfortable with regression
but new to high-dimensional mediation. It explains the problem the
package solves, builds up the idea behind the power-enhanced tests, then
walks through a first analysis, the output, the different outcome types,
a simulation study, and finally the real data application from the
article. You do not need to have read the article first; pointers to it
appear where the details live.

## 1. What is a mediation analysis?

A mediation analysis asks *how* an exposure affects an outcome. Instead
of only asking whether a treatment `X` changes an outcome `Y`, it asks
whether `X` works **through** an intermediate variable `M`, the
*mediator*. The classic picture is a chain:

            a                 b
       X  ----->   M   ----->   Y
        \                       /
         \________ c' _________/
                (direct)

The effect of `X` on `Y` that travels through `M` is the **indirect
effect**: in a linear model it is the product `a * b` of the `X -> M`
path and the `M -> Y` path. The part of `X`’s effect that does not go
through `M` is the **direct effect** `c'`. Their sum is the **total
effect**.

In modern applications there is rarely a single mediator. Genomics
studies screen thousands of methylation sites; the application later in
this vignette has 57 health-expenditure indicators. When there are many
candidate mediators `M = (M_1, ..., M_p)`, the natural first question is
simply:

> **Is there any active mediator at all?** That is, does `X` affect `Y`
> through *any* of the candidate mediators?

This is a single global hypothesis test, and it is what POEMED is built
to perform with high power.

## 2. The problem: total-indirect-effect tests have a blind spot

With many mediators, the conventional approach summarizes them by the
**total indirect effect**, written `beta`: the sum over all mediators of
each one’s individual indirect effect. The global test then checks
whether `beta = 0`.

This works well when the mediators all push the outcome the same way.
But consider two active mediators whose individual indirect effects are
equal in size and **opposite in sign**: say `+0.5` through `M_1` and
`-0.5` through `M_2`. Both mediators are genuinely active, yet their
contributions cancel, so the total indirect effect is

    beta = (+0.5) + (-0.5) = 0.

A test built on `beta` sees zero and concludes “no mediation,” even
though two mediators are plainly active. This is not a rare edge case:
whenever different pathways move an outcome in opposite directions
(**heterogeneous** mediation, and in the extreme **contrasting**
mediation), the total indirect effect understates the truth and the test
loses power. The article calls this out as the core limitation of
existing high-dimensional mediation tests.

## 3. The idea: a power enhancement component

The power-enhanced (PE) test fixes the blind spot by adding a second
piece that cannot cancel. After a penalized fit selects a small set of
candidate-active mediators, the PE component `J_m` adds up, over those
mediators, the **magnitude** of each one’s combined path signal. In code
notation, with `alpha_hat[j]` the estimated `M -> Y` coefficient of
mediator `j`, `Gamma_hat[i, j]` the estimated `X -> M` coefficient from
exposure `i`, and `se_*` their standard errors:

    J_m = sqrt(p) * sum over exposures i and selected mediators j of
          |alpha_hat[j] / se_alpha[j]| * |Gamma_hat[i, j] / se_Gamma[i, j]|
          * 1{both paths individually significant}

Two things matter here. First, the indicator keeps a mediator only when
**both** its `X -> M` path and its `M -> Y` path are individually
significant, so noise mediators do not contribute. Second, because `J_m`
sums **absolute values**, a `+0.5` mediator and a `-0.5` mediator
*reinforce* each other instead of cancelling. The full test statistic is
`M_PE = S_n + J_m`, the benchmark Wald statistic `S_n` (the
total-indirect-effect test) plus the enhancement. Under the global null
of no mediation, the screen rejects every mediator, so `J_m = 0` and
`M_PE` behaves exactly like `S_n` (same chi-square reference
distribution, so the same Type I error rate). Under heterogeneous
alternatives, `J_m` grows large and the test gains power. That is the
whole idea: **keep the size, add power exactly where the old test was
blind.**

The same indicator that builds `J_m` also tells you *which* mediators
are active, with familywise error rate control (the default) or false
discovery rate control.

## 4. A first analysis, step by step

The package can simulate data so you can see the method work before
bringing your own.
[`simulate_mediation_data()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_mediation_data.md)
generates the patterns studied in the article. Here is a **contrasting**
setting: a few active mediators whose effects cancel to a zero total
indirect effect.

``` r

set.seed(113)
d <- simulate_mediation_data(n = 200, p = 60, outcome = "continuous",
                             pattern = "contrasting", c1 = 1)
```

The result is a list. The four pieces an analysis needs are the
exposure, outcome, mediators, and (optionally) confounders:

``` r

dim(d$X)   # exposure: 200 observations, 1 column
#> [1] 200   1
length(d$Y)   # outcome: 200 values
#> [1] 200
dim(d$M)   # mediators: 200 x 60
#> [1] 200  60
d$active_mediators   # which mediators are truly active (the ground truth)
#> [1] 1 2 3 4
d$beta               # the total indirect effect: zero, by construction
#> [1] 0
```

So four mediators are genuinely active, but the total indirect effect is
zero because their effects cancel. This is precisely the situation that
defeats a total-indirect-effect test. Now run the global test:

``` r

fit <- pe_mediation(d$X, d$Y, d$M, outcome = "continuous")
fit
#>  term                  value   
#>  stat_hdmm             0.03881 
#>  pval_hdmm             0.8438  
#>  stat_pe               174.2   
#>  j_pe                  174.1   
#>  pval_pe               < 0.0001
#>  total_indirect_effect 0.01054 
#>  total_indirect_lower  -0.0943 
#>  total_indirect_upper  0.1154  
#>  n_active_mediators    1       
#>  df                    1       
#>  n_candidate_mediators 60      
#>  n_observations        200     
#> 
#> Outcome model: continuous (linear)
#> Active mediators identified (1): 2
#> Tuning parameter (HBIC): lambda = 0.199 from 20 values in [0.199, 0.388] (the grid's lower end)
```

Read the two p-values. `pval_hdmm` is the benchmark Wald test on the
total indirect effect; it is large, so that test fails to detect any
mediation (exactly the blind spot from Section 2). `pval_pe` is the
power-enhanced test; it is essentially zero, so it detects the mediation
decisively. The footer lists the individual mediators it flagged as
active. The power enhancement, made concrete.

## 5. Reading the result table

Every POEMED test returns a tidy table that prints with sensible
rounding (whole numbers without decimals, p-values to four places) while
storing full precision underneath. The rows are:

| term | meaning |
|----|----|
| `stat_hdmm`, `pval_hdmm` | the benchmark Wald statistic `S_n` and its p-value (the total-indirect-effect test of Guo et al.) |
| `stat_pe`, `pval_pe` | the power-enhanced statistic `M_PE` and its p-value |
| `j_pe` | the power enhancement component `J_m` (the amount added to `S_n`) |
| `total_indirect_effect` | the estimated total indirect effect `beta` |
| `n_active_mediators` | how many individual mediators were identified as active |
| `df` | degrees of freedom of the chi-square reference (the number of exposures) |
| `n_candidate_mediators`, `n_observations` | `p` and `n` |

To pull a number out, index the table like any data frame; the stored
value keeps full precision even though the display rounds:

``` r

fit$value[fit$term == "pval_pe"]            # the exact p-value
#> [1] 9.154634e-40
attr(fit, "active_mediators")               # the active mediator indices
#> [1] 2
```

## 6. Identifying which mediators are active

The active set is controlled by the `method` argument. The default,
`"Bonferroni"`, controls the familywise error rate: it is conservative,
so when it flags a mediator you can be confident, but it may miss weak
ones. The `"BH"` and `"BY"` options control the false discovery rate
instead and typically recover more mediators.

``` r

des_idx <- function(f) attr(f, "active_mediators")
des_idx(pe_mediation(d$X, d$Y, d$M, outcome = "continuous", method = "Bonferroni"))
#> [1] 2
des_idx(pe_mediation(d$X, d$Y, d$M, outcome = "continuous", method = "BH"))
#> [1] 2
```

The target error rate is `error_level` (default 0.05). It is distinct
from the significance level you use to read `pval_pe`; the global test
is insensitive to it.

## 7. Binary and count outcomes

The same construction works for non-continuous outcomes through a link
function. Name the outcome type and the front end dispatches to the
logistic (binary) or Poisson (count) model. The total indirect effect is
then on the link scale (log-odds for binary, log-mean for count).

``` r

set.seed(113)
db <- simulate_mediation_data(n = 250, p = 50, outcome = "binary",
                              pattern = "contrasting", c1 = 1, c2 = 1)
pe_mediation(db$X, db$Y, db$M, outcome = "binary")
#>  term                  value   
#>  stat_hdmm             0.009973
#>  pval_hdmm             0.9205  
#>  stat_pe               172.5   
#>  j_pe                  172.5   
#>  pval_pe               < 0.0001
#>  total_indirect_effect -0.01329
#>  total_indirect_lower  -0.2741 
#>  total_indirect_upper  0.2475  
#>  n_active_mediators    1       
#>  df                    1       
#>  n_candidate_mediators 50      
#>  n_observations        250     
#> 
#> Outcome model: binary (logistic)
#> Active mediators identified (1): 2
#> Tuning parameter (HBIC): lambda = 0.05 from 20 values in [0.05, 1] (the grid's lower end)
```

## 8. A simulation study: size and power

[`pe_power_curve()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_power_curve.md)
reproduces the article’s Monte Carlo studies. It sweeps the signal
strength `c1`, simulating many data sets at each value and recording how
often each test rejects. At `c1 = 0` (no mediation) the rejection rate
estimates the Type I error rate; at nonzero `c1` it estimates power. A
rate from `n_rep` replications carries a Monte Carlo standard error of
about `sqrt(r * (1 - r) / n_rep)`, so the 40-replication run below knows
a rate near 0.05 to within about 0.03 and a rate near 0.5 to within
about 0.08.

``` r

set.seed(113)
pc <- pe_power_curve(n = 150, p = 50, outcome = "continuous",
                     pattern = "contrasting", c1_grid = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
                     n_rep = 40)
pc
#>  c1   rejection_hdmm rejection_pe n_valid n_empty
#>  0    0.025          0.05         40      0      
#>  0.25 0.025          0.025        40      0      
#>  0.5  0.025          0.075        40      0      
#>  0.75 0.05           0.175        40      0      
#>  1    0.225          0.375        40      0      
#> 
#> Outcome: continuous

plot(pc$c1, pc$rejection_pe, type = "b", pch = 19, ylim = c(0, 1),
     xlab = expression(c[1] * " (signal strength)"),
     ylab = "empirical rejection rate",
     main = "Contrasting mediation: PE vs. benchmark")
lines(pc$c1, pc$rejection_hdmm, type = "b", pch = 1, lty = 2)
abline(h = 0.05, col = "grey60", lty = 3)
legend("right", c("power-enhanced", "benchmark Wald"), pch = c(19, 1),
       lty = c(1, 2), bty = "n")
```

![Rejection-rate curves for the benchmark and power-enhanced
tests](POEMED_files/figure-html/power-1.png)

At `c1 = 0` both tests reject at about the nominal rate. As the
contrasting signal grows the benchmark rejects in 22 percent of
replications at `c1 = 1` and the power-enhanced test in 38 percent. That
is the enhancement at work, but at this small design it is modest, and
the reason is worth knowing. The default tuning grid is the article’s
grid rescaled to `n` and `p` (see
[`?pe_lambda_grid`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_lambda_grid.md)),
and its lower end is set where the mediators the test names keep their
familywise error guarantee. At `n = 150` and `p = 50` that floor also
removes signal. The review-era grid, 20 values from 0.05 to 1, trades
the guarantee for power on the same simulated data sets:

``` r

pc_review <- pe_power_curve(n = 150, p = 50, outcome = "continuous",
                            pattern = "contrasting",
                            c1_grid = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), n_rep = 40,
                            lambda_grid = seq(0.05, 1, length.out = 20),
                            seed = 113)
pc_review
#>  c1   rejection_hdmm rejection_pe n_valid n_empty
#>  0    0.05           0.075        40      0      
#>  0.25 0.025          0.1          40      0      
#>  0.5  0              0.3          40      0      
#>  0.75 0.025          0.75         40      0      
#>  1    0.1            0.975        40      0      
#> 
#> Outcome: continuous
```

With it the power-enhanced test rejects in 98 percent of replications at
`c1 = 1`, but the mediators it names can include null ones: at the
article’s design that grid raises the identified set’s familywise error
rate from 0.000 to about 0.17. At the article’s design (`n = 300`,
`p = 500`, 1000 replications) the default grid gives the article’s
Figure 1(b): the power-enhanced test rejects in about 76 percent of
replications at `c1 = 1` and the benchmark in about 15 percent, and at
`c1 = 0.5` the printed rates are 0.331 and 0.087 (the reproduction
vignette runs those settings). Choose the grid by what the analysis
needs: the default when the identified mediators will be reported, the
wider grid when only the global test matters at a small design.

## 9. The real application: health spending as a mediator

The package ships the article’s empirical data, `WHO_health_mediation`:
a panel of 91 WHO member states over 2000–2021. The exposure is annual
growth in GDP per capita, the candidate mediators are 57
health-expenditure indicators from the WHO Global Health Expenditure
Database, and there are five health outcomes (infant and under-five
mortality, life expectancy, low birthweight, and undernourishment). The
substantive question: **does health spending mediate the relationship
between economic growth and population health?**

``` r

data(WHO_health_mediation)
dim(WHO_health_mediation)
#> [1] 2002   68
WHO_health_mediation[1:3, c("country", "region", "income", "year",
                            "gdp_growth", "imr", "gge_gdp")]
#>     country region       income year gdp_growth  imr gge_gdp
#> 1 Argentina    AMR Upper-middle 2000  -1.906987 17.3    25.2
#> 2 Argentina    AMR Upper-middle 2001  -5.453797 16.8    26.4
#> 3 Argentina    AMR Upper-middle 2002 -11.845950 16.4    21.9
```

The 57 mediators are strongly intercorrelated (many are different
normalizations of the same spending), which is exactly the
high-dimensional, correlated-mediator regime the method targets. Their
definitions are in `WHO_indicator_codebook`:

``` r

head(WHO_indicator_codebook, 4)
#>    indicator
#> 1    che_gdp
#> 2 che_pc_usd
#> 3        che
#> 4      gghed
#>                                                             description
#> 1 Current Health Expenditure (CHE) as % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
#> 2                    Current Health Expenditure (CHE) per capita in US$
#> 3                                      Current Health Expenditure (CHE)
#> 4               Domestic General Government Health Expenditure (GGHE-D)
```

### Building one analysis design

[`WHO_mediation_design()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_design.md)
assembles the exposure, outcome, mediator, and confounder matrices for a
chosen outcome, handling the missing-data coverage and the confounders
(region, income group, and year) for you. The article standardizes the
exposure and the mediators and centers the outcome, but leaves the
confounder indicators unscaled; the call below does the same by hand and
passes `scale = FALSE`.

``` r

des <- WHO_mediation_design("imr")          # infant mortality rate
c(observations = des$n, mediators = ncol(des$M), confounders = ncol(des$Z))
#> observations    mediators  confounders 
#>         2002           57            9

fit <- pe_mediation(scale(des$X), des$Y - mean(des$Y), scale(des$M),
                    Z = des$Z, outcome = "continuous", scale = FALSE,
                    lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 100))
active <- des$indicators[attr(fit, "active_mediators")]
WHO_indicator_codebook$description[
  match(active, WHO_indicator_codebook$indicator)]
#> [1] "General Government Expenditure (GGE) as % of GDP"
```

The PE test identifies general government expenditure as a share of GDP
(`gge_gdp`) as the mediator through which economic growth reaches infant
mortality, which is the article’s global finding.

### Reproducing the article’s table

[`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
runs the whole set of models the article reports for one outcome
(global, then within each WHO region and income group), using the
article’s preprocessing, and returns a table in the shape of the
article’s Table for that outcome.

``` r

res <- WHO_mediation_analysis("imr", groupings = c("global", "region"),
                              lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 10, length.out = 40))
res[, c("group", "n_countries", "pval_hdmm", "pval_pe", "active_mediators")]
#>  group n_countries pval_hdmm pval_pe  active_mediators 
#>  ALL   91          0.0409    < 0.0001 gge_gdp          
#>  AFR   32          0.4415    0.4415   none             
#>  AMR   28          0.4129    0.4129   none             
#>  EMR   8           0.0304    0.0304   none             
#>  EUR   9           0.0035    < 0.0001 gge_gdp          
#>  SEAR  5           0.3087    < 0.0001 ext_usd2021_pc   
#>  WPR   9           0.8721    < 0.0001 chi_che, pvtd_gdp
```

Compare the benchmark and PE columns. In several regions the benchmark
test sees nothing (`pval_hdmm` large) while the PE test rejects
decisively and names the responsible indicator: in the Western Pacific
region, for example, the benchmark p-value is near 1 yet the PE test
detects compulsory health insurance and private expenditure as active
mediators. These are the cases where heterogeneous mediation hides the
signal from the conventional test, and they reproduce the findings in
the article.

[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) reads that comparison
off the table for you, counting the groups where the PE test detects
mediation the benchmark misses:

``` r

summary(res)
#> POEMED comparison: IMR
#>   groups: 7 (7 with data), alpha_level = 0.05
#>   detected by benchmark (HDMM): 3   by power-enhanced (PE): 5
#>   PE detects mediation in 2 groups the benchmark misses:
#>  group n_countries pval_hdmm  pval_pe  active_mediators
#>   SEAR           5     0.309 4.13e-41    ext_usd2021_pc
#>    WPR           9     0.872 3.77e-83 chi_che, pvtd_gdp
#>   most-flagged mediators:
#>     gge_gdp            2
#>     chi_che            1
#>     ext_usd2021_pc     1
#>     pvtd_gdp           1
```

### Why the preprocessing matters

[`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
applies the article’s preprocessing internally. Passing the raw design
to
[`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md)
with the default `scale = TRUE` standardizes the confounder indicators
as well, and that is a different model: on the same tuning grid the
benchmark Wald p-value moves from about 0.041 to about 0.23, and the
penalized selection adds a second indicator, social health insurance
(`shi_che`).

``` r

raw <- pe_mediation(des$X, des$Y, des$M, Z = des$Z, outcome = "continuous",
                    lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 100))
c(article_preprocessing = fit$value[fit$term == "pval_hdmm"],
  raw_matrices = raw$value[raw$term == "pval_hdmm"])
#> article_preprocessing          raw_matrices 
#>            0.04094124            0.23191044
des$indicators[attr(raw, "active_mediators")]
#> [1] "shi_che" "gge_gdp"

Use the article’s preprocessing (or
[`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md),
which applies it) whenever the goal is to reproduce its numbers.

## 10. Beyond the global test: the toolkit

The global test is the core, but POEMED ships a few conveniences around
it.

### A formula interface for data frames

If your variables live in a data frame,
[`pe_mediate()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediate.md)
takes a formula for the outcome and exposure, the names of the mediator
columns, and (optionally) confounder names, and calls
[`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md)
for you.

``` r

set.seed(113)
d <- simulate_mediation_data(n = 200, p = 60, outcome = "continuous",
                             pattern = "contrasting", c1 = 1)
df <- data.frame(y = d$Y, x = d$X[, 1], d$M)
meds <- grep("^X", names(df), value = TRUE)   # the mediator columns
fit <- pe_mediate(y ~ x, data = df, mediators = meds, outcome = "continuous")
```

### Why each mediator? The per-mediator table

[`pe_mediators()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediators.md)
opens up the screening step: for every candidate mediator the penalized
fit selected, it shows the two path statistics, the two path p-values,
the combined screening p-value, and whether the mediator was flagged
active. This is how you see *why* the test reached its conclusion.

``` r

pe_mediators(fit)
#>  mediator name t_outcome t_exposure screen_p selected
#>  1        X1   18.22     0.3641     0.7158   FALSE   
#>  2        X2   -7.179    3.131      0.0017    TRUE
```

[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) shows the same
evidence graphically, the screening strength of each selected mediator
with the active ones highlighted.

``` r

plot(fit)
```

mediators](POEMED_files/figure-html/plot-mediators-1.png)

### broom verbs

[`tidy()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/poemed_broom.md)
returns the per-mediator table and
[`glance()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/poemed_broom.md)
a one-row summary, so a POEMED result drops into broom and tidyverse
workflows.

``` r

glance(fit)
#>    stat_hdmm pval_hdmm  stat_pe      pval_pe total_indirect_effect
#> 1 0.03881027  0.843825 174.1554 9.154634e-40            0.01053815
#>   n_active_mediators n_observations
#> 1                  1            200
```

### All three multiplicity methods at once

Pass `report_all_methods = TRUE` and
[`pe_selection()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_selection.md)
reports the active set under Bonferroni (familywise error rate),
Benjamini-Hochberg, and Benjamini-Yekutieli (false discovery rate) side
by side, as the supplement of the article does.

``` r

fit_all <- pe_mediation(d$X, d$Y, d$M, outcome = "continuous",
                        report_all_methods = TRUE)
pe_selection(fit_all)
#>  method     n_active j_pe  stat_pe pval_pe  active_mediators
#>  Bonferroni 1        174.1 174.2   < 0.0001 2               
#>  BH         1        174.1 174.2   < 0.0001 2               
#>  BY         1        174.1 174.2   < 0.0001 2
```

### Planning the sample size

[`ss_power_pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/ss_power_pe_mediation.md)
plans a study: over a grid of candidate sample sizes it estimates the
power of the PE test by simulation and reports the smallest sample size
that reaches the target power. It runs a Monte Carlo study, so it is
shown here but not evaluated.

``` r

plan <- ss_power_pe_mediation(outcome = "continuous", pattern = "contrasting",
                              p = 50, n_grid = c(80, 120, 160, 200),
                              target_power = 0.8, n_rep = 100)
plan
attr(plan, "recommended_n")
```

## 11. Bringing your own data

To analyze your own study, arrange:

- `X`: an `n`-by-`q` matrix of exposures (often one column).
- `Y`: a length-`n` outcome (continuous, 0/1, or counts).
- `M`: an `n`-by-`p` matrix of candidate mediators (`p` may exceed `n`).
- `Z` (optional): an `n`-by-`d` matrix of confounders.

then call `pe_mediation(X, Y, M, Z, outcome = ...)`. The defaults
standardize the inputs as the method assumes, choose the tuning
parameter by a high-dimensional information criterion from a grid whose
lower end keeps the identified set’s error-rate guarantee, and control
the familywise error rate when identifying active mediators. Everything
returned is an ordinary data frame you can index, save, or plot, and the
print footer reports the tuning parameter chosen.

### When POEMED Is the Right Tool, and When It Is Not

The tests assume a linear (or generalized linear) outcome model with a
sparse set of active mediators, standardized inputs, and complete data.
Some practical limits, seen on simulated data during the package’s
release audit:

- Sample size. The penalized selection needs `n` large relative to
  `log(p)` and to the signal; with `n` near 100 and `p` in the thousands
  under the contrasting pattern the selection keeps a single mediator
  and the power-enhanced test has no power to add. The default grid’s
  floor rises as `n` falls (see
  [`?pe_lambda_grid`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_lambda_grid.md)),
  which protects the identified set but costs global power at small
  designs; the section on the simulation study above shows the size of
  that cost.
- Strongly correlated mediators. With an autoregressive correlation of
  0.9 among neighboring mediators the selection keeps one representative
  of a correlated block, so the identified set is unstable from sample
  to sample even when the global test rejects.
- Rare binary outcomes. With about 2 to 3 percent events at `n = 300`
  the penalized logistic fit selects nothing at any grid value; the fit
  is empty and the function says so (see
  [`?pe_mediation`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md)).
- Overdispersed counts. The count model is Poisson; under negative
  binomial overdispersion its size was not inflated at `n = 200`,
  `p = 100`, but about a tenth of the fits were empty.
- Missing values are not handled; complete the data first.
