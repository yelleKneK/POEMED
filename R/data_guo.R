#' Calibration Constants for the Real-Data-Motivated Heterogeneous Setting
#'
#' The fixed constants for the real-data-motivated heterogeneous mediation
#' simulation of Yu and Kelley (in press), calibrated to the DNA-methylation
#' case study of Guo et al. (2022): a \eqn{p = 1008}{p = 1008}-mediator linear
#' model with eleven active loci whose effects mix positive and negative signs.
#' [simulate_guo_mediation()] generates data from these constants; the object is
#' exported so the exact calibration is inspectable.
#'
#' Pairing the exposure-mediator coefficients `Gamma_x` with the
#' outcome-mediator coefficients `alpha_m` gives a total indirect effect of
#' `beta_per_c1` \eqn{\approx -1.597}{approximately -1.597} per unit of the
#' signal scale \eqn{c_1}{c1}. (The article reports \eqn{-1.5977}{-1.5977},
#' computed from the full-precision Guo coefficients; the values shipped here
#' are those coefficients rounded to the three decimals printed in the
#' supplement, which give \eqn{-1.597}{-1.597}.)

#' @format A list with components:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{p, s, n}{The mediator count (1008), confounder count (9, an
#'     intercept plus eight covariates), and case-study sample size (85).}
#'   \item{locations}{Indices of the eleven active mediators.}
#'   \item{alpha_m}{Outcome-mediator coefficients at the active loci (the
#'     designed simulation values).}
#'   \item{Gamma_x}{Exposure-mediator coefficients at the active loci.}
#'   \item{alpha_z}{Confounder-outcome coefficients (length 9).}
#'   \item{Gamma_z}{Confounder-mediator coefficients at the active loci (an
#'     11 by 9 matrix).}
#'   \item{beta_per_c1}{The total indirect effect per unit `c1`, equal to
#'     `sum(Gamma_x * alpha_m)` \eqn{\approx -1.597}{approximately -1.597} (the
#'     article reports -1.5977 from the unrounded coefficients).}
#'   \item{alpha_m_estimated}{The raw Guo et al. (2022) estimate of the
#'     outcome-mediator coefficients (for reference; the simulation uses the
#'     designed `alpha_m`).}
#'   \item{alpha_m_variants}{Two alternative outcome-mediator coefficient sets
#'     the article also studies, `homogeneous_like` and `contrasting_like`,
#'     which remain heterogeneous when paired with `Gamma_x`.}
