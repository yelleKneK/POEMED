# Per-mediator detail behind a power-enhanced mediation test

Returns the per-mediator table that explains a
[`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md)
result: one row for each mediator the penalized fit selected as a
candidate, with its two path statistics, the screening p-value, and
whether it was identified as active. This is the "why" behind the active
set, so a user can see which mediators were close to the screening
threshold and which were screened out.

## Usage

``` r
pe_mediators(fit)
```

## Arguments

- fit:

  A result from
  [`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md)
  or one of its workers.

## Value

A tidy `data.frame` (class `poemed_tbl`) with columns:

- mediator:

  Column position of the mediator in the original `M`.

- name:

  The mediator's column name in `M`; present only when `M` has column
  names.

- t_outcome:

  The standardized mediator-on-outcome statistic (the \\M \to Y\\ path,
  \\\hat\alpha\_{m,j} / \hat\sigma\_{m,j}\\).

- t_exposure:

  The strongest standardized exposure-on-mediator statistic across
  exposures (the \\X \to M\\ path).

- screen_p:

  The screening p-value, the larger of the two path p-values (the
  smaller across exposures when there are several). A mediator is active
  when this clears the multiplicity threshold.

- selected:

  Logical; whether the mediator was identified as active.

The table is empty when the fit selected no candidate mediators.
