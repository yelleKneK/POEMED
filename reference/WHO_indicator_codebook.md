# Codebook for the WHO health-expenditure indicators

The 57 health-expenditure indicators that serve as candidate mediators
in
[WHO_health_mediation](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_health_mediation.md),
with their short codes and full descriptions, transcribed from the
article's supplementary codebook. Many indicators are alternative
normalizations of the same underlying spending (per capita, percent of
GDP, percent of current health expenditure, current versus constant 2021
currency, national currency versus US dollars versus purchasing power
parity), which is why they are strongly intercorrelated.

## Usage

``` r
WHO_indicator_codebook
```

## Format

A `data.frame` with 57 rows and 2 columns:

- indicator:

  The short indicator code, matching a column name in
  [WHO_health_mediation](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_health_mediation.md)
  (for example `gge_gdp`, `shi_che`).

- description:

  The full indicator name. Common abbreviations: CHE (current health
  expenditure), GGHE-D (domestic general government health expenditure),
  PVT-D (domestic private health expenditure), EXT (external health
  expenditure), OOPS (out-of-pocket spending), SHI (social health
  insurance), GGE (general government expenditure), GDP (gross domestic
  product), NCU (national currency unit), PPP (purchasing power parity).
