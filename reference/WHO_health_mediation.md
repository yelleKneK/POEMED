# WHO / World Bank health-expenditure mediation data (benchmark data set)

A benchmark data set for high-dimensional mediation methods: the World
Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank panel analyzed in the source
article. It is a country-by-year panel used to ask how health-care
expenditure mediates the relationship between economic growth and
population health outcomes. The exposure is economic growth, the
candidate mediators are 57 health-expenditure indicators, and five
health outcomes are available. With 57 intercorrelated mediators this is
a genuinely high-dimensional mediation problem of the kind the
power-enhanced tests are built for, and the mediation effects are
heterogeneous (different kinds of spending push different outcomes in
different directions), which is exactly where the benchmark test loses
power and the PE test does not.

## Usage

``` r
WHO_health_mediation
```

## Format

`WHO_health_mediation` is a `data.frame` with 2002 rows (91 WHO member
states times the years 2000–2021) and 68 columns:

- code:

  ISO-3166 alpha-3 country code.

- country:

  Country name.

- region:

  WHO region: `AFR` (Africa, 32 members), `AMR` (Americas, 28), `EMR`
  (Eastern Mediterranean, 8), `EUR` (Europe, 9), `SEAR` (South-East
  Asia, 5), `WPR` (Western Pacific, 9).

- income:

  World Bank income group, a factor ordered low to high: `Low` (16
  members), `Lower-middle` (27), `Upper-middle` (26), `High` (22). The
  article abbreviates these Low, LM, UM, High.

- year:

  Calendar year, 2000–2021.

- gdp_growth:

  The exposure \\X\\: annual percentage growth of GDP per capita (World
  Bank Open Data), a common proxy for economic growth.

- imr:

  Infant mortality rate (deaths per 1000 live births).

- u5mr:

  Under-five mortality rate (deaths per 1000 live births).

- leb:

  Life expectancy at birth (years).

- lbw:

  Prevalence of low birthweight (percent of live births; covers 73
  members, 2000–2020, so other rows are `NA`).

- pou:

  Prevalence of undernourishment (percent of population; covers 79
  members, 2001–2021, so other rows are `NA`).

- che_gdp, ..., ext_usd2021_pc:

  The 57 candidate mediators \\M\\: health-expenditure indicators from
  the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database. Their codes and full names
  are in
  [WHO_indicator_codebook](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_indicator_codebook.md).
  They are complete (no missing values).

## Source

Exposure and health outcomes: World Bank Open Data
(<https://data.worldbank.org/>). Health-expenditure mediators and the
region / income labels: WHO Global Health Expenditure Database
(<https://apps.who.int/nha/database>). Merged and filtered for the
article; see `data-raw/WHO_health_mediation.R` in the package sources.

## Details

It is shipped as a benchmark so that a method, old or new, can be
evaluated on a real, published high-dimensional mediation problem with a
known set of findings (see
[`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md),
whose output is the benchmark fit). The World Health Organization (WHO)
is the source of the health-expenditure mediators and the region and
income labels; the World Bank is the source of the economic-growth
exposure and the health outcomes.

Three of the five health outcomes (`imr`, `u5mr`, `leb`) cover all 91
members for 2000–2021; `lbw` and `pou` have narrower coverage, so they
carry `NA` where unavailable. The mediators are intercorrelated by
construction, since many are different normalizations of the same
underlying spending (per capita, percent of GDP, percent of current
health expenditure, constant versus current currency, and so on), which
is precisely the high-dimensional, correlated-mediator regime the
methods target.

Use
[`WHO_mediation_design()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_design.md)
to assemble the exposure, outcome, mediator, and confounder matrices for
a given outcome (and optionally a region or income subset) ready for
[`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md).
In the article's global model the confounders are the region, income
group, and year.
