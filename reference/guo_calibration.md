# Calibration constants for the real-data-motivated heterogeneous setting

The fixed constants for the article's real-data-motivated heterogeneous
mediation simulation, calibrated to the DNA-methylation case study of
Guo et al. (2022): a \\p = 1008\\-mediator linear model with eleven
active loci whose effects mix positive and negative signs.
[`simulate_guo_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_guo_mediation.md)
generates data from these constants; the object is exported so the exact
calibration is inspectable.

## Usage

``` r
guo_calibration
```

## Format

A list with components:

- p, s, n:

  The mediator count (1008), confounder count (9, an intercept plus
  eight covariates), and case-study sample size (85).

- locations:

  Indices of the eleven active mediators.

- alpha_m:

  Outcome-mediator coefficients at the active loci (the designed
  simulation values).

- Gamma_x:

  Exposure-mediator coefficients at the active loci.

- alpha_z:

  Confounder-outcome coefficients (length 9).

- Gamma_z:

  Confounder-mediator coefficients at the active loci (an 11 by 9
  matrix).

- beta_per_c1:

  The total indirect effect per unit `c1`, equal to
  `sum(Gamma_x * alpha_m)` \\\approx -1.597\\ (the article reports
  -1.5977 from the unrounded coefficients).

- alpha_m_estimated:

  The raw Guo et al. (2022) estimate of the outcome-mediator
  coefficients (for reference; the simulation uses the designed
  `alpha_m`).

- alpha_m_variants:

  Two alternative outcome-mediator coefficient sets the article also
  studies, `homogeneous_like` and `contrasting_like`, which remain
  heterogeneous when paired with `Gamma_x`.

## Source

Transcribed from the supplement of the article (its
parameter-configuration section), which in turn calibrates to the
`simulation_allS.Rdata` of Guo et al. (2022).

## Details

Pairing the exposure-mediator coefficients `Gamma_x` with the
outcome-mediator coefficients `alpha_m` gives a total indirect effect of
`beta_per_c1` \\\approx -1.597\\ per unit of the signal scale \\c_1\\.
(The article reports \\-1.5977\\, computed from the full-precision Guo
coefficients; the values shipped here are those coefficients rounded to
the three decimals printed in the supplement, which give \\-1.597\\.)
