# Simulate the real-data-motivated heterogeneous mediation setting

Generates a linear mediation data set from the article's
*real-data-motivated* heterogeneous setting, whose coefficients are
calibrated to the DNA-methylation case study of Guo et al. (2022).
Unlike the homogeneous and contrasting presets of
[`simulate_mediation_data()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_mediation_data.md),
this setting has eleven active mediators with a genuine **mix of
positive and negative** effects that neither all agree in sign
(homogeneous) nor exactly cancel (contrasting): the messy middle ground
that real data tends to present. The calibration constants are the
[guo_calibration](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/guo_calibration.md)
object; the total indirect effect is `guo_calibration$beta_per_c1`
\\\times c_1 \approx -1.597\\c_1\\. (The article reports
\\-1.5977\\c_1\\, from the full-precision Guo coefficients; the values
shipped here are those coefficients rounded to three decimals.)

## Usage

``` r
simulate_guo_mediation(
  c1,
  c2 = 0.5,
  confounders = FALSE,
  alpha_m = "setting0",
  n = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- c1:

  Signal-strength scale for the exposure-mediator coefficients
  (`Gamma_x = c1 * Gamma_x_G`). At `c1 = 0` there is no mediation (the
  Type I error setting); the article sweeps `c1` over
  `c(0, +/- 0.1, ..., +/- 1)`.

- c2:

  Direct effect (exposure-outcome coefficient). Default 0.5.

- confounders:

  Logical; if `TRUE`, include the calibrated confounders in the
  data-generating process (the article's "with confounders" scenario).
  Default `FALSE`.

- alpha_m:

  Outcome-mediator coefficients at the eleven active loci: either a
  numeric vector of length 11, or one of the strings `"setting0"` (the
  default `(1, 0.9, 0.8, -0.9, -0.8, -0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2)`),
  `"homogeneous_like"`, or `"contrasting_like"` (the two alternative
  sets the article also studies, which remain heterogeneous because they
  are paired with the scattered `Gamma_x`).

- n:

  Number of observations. Default the case-study size, 85.

- seed:

  Optional integer seed, set locally with the caller's random number
  generator state restored on exit.

## Value

A list with the same shape as
[`simulate_mediation_data()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/simulate_mediation_data.md):
the exposure `X` (`n` by 1), mediators `M` (`n` by 1008), outcome `Y`,
confounders `Z` (`n` by 8, or `NULL`), the full coefficient vectors
`alpha_m` and `Gamma_x`, the total indirect effect `beta`, the
`active_mediators` (the eleven loci, or none when `c1 = 0`), and the
dimensions.

## Details

The mediator dimension (\\p = 1008\\), the eleven active loci, and the
coefficient vectors come from Guo et al. (2022) and are fixed. The
exposure and confounders, which the article took from the actual
case-study data, are simulated here (standard normal) so the function is
self-contained; the scientifically relevant calibration, the mediator
and outcome coefficients, is exact.

## Examples

``` r
set.seed(113)
d <- simulate_guo_mediation(c1 = 0.5)
dim(d$M)               # 85 x 1008
#> [1]   85 1008
d$active_mediators     # the 11 active loci
#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
round(d$beta, 4)       # beta_per_c1 * 0.5, i.e. -0.7985
#> [1] -0.7985
# At the case study's n = 85 the signal is faint for either test. With
# n = 150 and a wider tuning grid (the guided tour's setting) both tests
# reject the global null, and the power-enhanced test additionally
# identifies several of the eleven active loci.
d2 <- simulate_guo_mediation(c1 = 1, n = 150, seed = 113)
fit <- pe_mediation(d2$X, d2$Y, d2$M, outcome = "continuous",
                    lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 10, length.out = 50))
fit[fit$term %in% c("pval_hdmm", "pval_pe", "n_active_mediators"), ]
#>  term               value   
#>  pval_hdmm          < 0.0001
#>  pval_pe            < 0.0001
#>  n_active_mediators 6       
#> 
#> Outcome model: continuous (linear)
#> Active mediators identified (6): 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10
#> Tuning parameter (HBIC): lambda = 0.1 from 50 values in [0.1, 10] (the grid's lower end)
