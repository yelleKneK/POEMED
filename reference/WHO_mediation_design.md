# Build a mediation design from the WHO health-expenditure data

Assembles the exposure, outcome, mediator, and confounder matrices for
one of the analyses in the article from
[WHO_health_mediation](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_health_mediation.md),
ready to pass to
[`pe_mediation()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/pe_mediation.md).
The exposure is GDP per capita growth, the mediators are the 57
health-expenditure indicators, and the outcome is the chosen health
indicator. Optionally restrict to a WHO region and/or a World Bank
income group, reproducing the article's region-specific,
income-specific, and region-by-income models.

## Usage

``` r
WHO_mediation_design(
  outcome = c("imr", "u5mr", "leb", "lbw", "pou"),
  region = NULL,
  income = NULL,
  data = WHO_health_mediation
)
```

## Arguments

- outcome:

  Which health outcome to use as \\Y\\: `"imr"` (infant mortality rate),
  `"u5mr"` (under-five mortality rate), `"leb"` (life expectancy at
  birth), `"lbw"` (prevalence of low birthweight), or `"pou"`
  (prevalence of undernourishment).

- region:

  Optional character vector of WHO regions to keep (`"AFR"`, `"AMR"`,
  `"EMR"`, `"EUR"`, `"SEAR"`, `"WPR"`). Default `NULL` keeps all
  regions.

- income:

  Optional character vector of income groups to keep (`"Low"`,
  `"Lower-middle"`, `"Upper-middle"`, `"High"`). Default `NULL` keeps
  all groups.

- data:

  The source data frame. Defaults to
  [WHO_health_mediation](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_health_mediation.md).

## Value

A list with `X` (exposure, \\n \times 1\\), `Y` (outcome vector), `M`
(the \\n \times 57\\ mediator matrix), `Z` (the confounder matrix, or
`NULL` if no covariate varies), and the metadata `outcome`, `n`
(country-year observations), `n_countries` (unique countries),
`indicators`, `region`, and `income`.

## Details

Rows with a missing outcome or missing exposure are dropped (the article
handles each outcome's coverage separately, which is why the
low-birthweight and undernourishment outcomes have fewer observations).
The confounder matrix \\Z\\ contains the WHO region and income group (as
indicator variables) and the year (numeric), exactly as in the article,
but only for covariates that still vary after subsetting: a
region-specific model drops the (now constant) region, and unused factor
levels are dropped so no all-zero indicator columns remain.

To reproduce the article's exact test statistics, fit with the article's
preprocessing, standardizing the exposure and mediators and centering
the outcome while leaving the confounder indicators unscaled:


      des <- WHO_mediation_design("imr")
      pe_mediation(scale(des$X), des$Y - mean(des$Y), scale(des$M),
                   Z = des$Z, outcome = "continuous", scale = FALSE,
                   lambda_grid = seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 100))

The simpler call
`pe_mediation(des$X, des$Y, des$M, des$Z, outcome = "continuous")`
standardizes every block, including \\Z\\, and so fits a different
model: scaling the indicator columns changes both the benchmark Wald
test and the penalized selection, so its p-values and its active set
need not match the article's (on the default tuning grid the global IMR
active set happens to agree; on the article's 100-point grid it does
not).
[`WHO_mediation_analysis()`](https://yelleknek.github.io/POEMED/reference/WHO_mediation_analysis.md)
applies the article's preprocessing for you.
